        <p><strong>Camel Origami<br></strong>
            Camels have three sets of eyelids and two rows of eyelashes to keep sand out of their eyes<br>
            Camels have thick lips which let them forage for thorny plants other animals can't eat<br>
            There are two types of camels: One humped or “dromedary” camels and two humped Bactrian camels
